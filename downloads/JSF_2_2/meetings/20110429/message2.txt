    => edburns    

    4. 901-DeprecateTargets

       Concern is the usage of this "targets" concepts.  The interface
       has pointers into the implementation section.  We'd like to
       reverse the ordering so that the impl can "reach out" and point to
       things in the interface section.

       => edburns grant ngriffin7a commit access

       => ngriffin7a create branch from trunk and put old school file upload

    6. 479-UIDataCollection

       => edburns the solution will involve how to flatten a Collection
       into a List.
